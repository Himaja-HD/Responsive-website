<p class="text-secondary">Promoting Sustainable Livelihood And Self-Reliance Among Tribal People Community.</p>

<p class="text-secondary">Our Goushala is inspiring and encouraging the tribal community of India<br>
    to grow and develop. We believe that they must make a sustainable living<br>
    for self-reliance and increased confidence. Therefore, we are passionate<br>
    about enlightening and enriching the tribal community with their skills and <br>
    craftsmanship. With a mission to bridge the gap between the tribal and <br>
    modern civilization, Our Goushala is supporting tribal women, men and farmers to<br>
    “Earn a pay better than fair” with the help of their natural produce <br>
    from the land and livestock.</p>
